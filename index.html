Soon after their sexual affair began, Hamilton’s wife took their kids to vist her father in Albany. 
            Soon Maria’s husband James Reynolds found out of this affair and confronted Hamilton. In his letter he demanded 1,000 (about 25,000 today) to keep quiet. Hamilton paid the full amount by January 1792, but James stayed in town despite his promise to leave. He even encouraged to keep the affair going with his wife, who claimed to be Hamilton’s devoted lover. 
            Through the spring he kept asking for small “loans” until Hamilton stopped seeing Maria for good in the summer of 1792.

        <p>The fall of 1796 a series of essays written under the name “Phocion.”(the good)  Hamilton threw shade on Jefferson’s private life. He included a pretty big hint about his alleged relationship with one of his slaves, Sally Hemings. (Insert link here <)  Journalist James Challender responded  in the summer of 1797 saying that not only Hamilton had his own sexual offenses, but Hamilton also used federal funds to illegally regard in government securities with Reynolds. 
            Give the charges against him Hamilton decided to come clean about his unfaithfulness so that he could defend himself on the speculation charges, which not only ruined his career but would also permanently damage the Federalist Party and the U.S. Treasury. In late April 1797  he published what would later become known as the Reynolds Pamphlet. Where he shared details about his affair and the blackmail payment he made in James Reynolds.

        <p>In the close end the Reynolds Pamphlet denied the more serious accusations against him, it also humiliated his wife and ended any change of him ever becoming president. The it didn’t end his career fully.  He continued to exert influence during President John Adams’ Federalist administration, until his feud with Adams exploded into a pubic attack on the President just before the election of 1800. Adams lost to Jefferson that year ending the Federalist Party.
