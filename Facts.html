        <h1>Ten Hamilton Facts</h1>

        <h3> 1. Hamilton was Fluent in French</h3>
        <p>Alexander Hamilton grew up with French as his second language. His mother was of half-French Huguenot and half-British descent. These facts about Alexander Hamilton proved to be beneficial for the lad. He was sent out on important tasks and military missions for his command of the French language. Hamilton, later on, became a liaison officer between the French generals and admirals and George Washington.

        <h3>2. Hamilton received George Washington’s last known letter
        </h3>
        <p>George Washington wrote his final known letter, and sent it to Alexander Hamilton on December 12, 1799, before his death. He died two days later. The letter was revealed to be Alexander’s plan for a military academy.                               Hamilton served with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Hamilton and Washington proved to have grown closer in their four years together in service. Moreover, Washington included Hamilton in his correspondence.

        <h3>3. His last words were likely a prayer
        </h3>
        <p>Records show that Hamilton’s last words differ from varying accounts. However, historians accept his last words are as such: “I have no ill will against Colonel Burr. I met him with a fixed resolution to do him no harm,” he continued on to say that he has forgiven all that has happened. Hamilton remained alive for at least a day and a half after being shot. Accounts show he asked for his wife immediately after his comrades took care of him. Hamilton asked his friends to break the events gradually to her and give her hopes to cling to. Finally, a priest was present by his deathbed even after final visits from his friends and family. It’s most probable that his last words were a prayer asking for mercy, humbly opening up to be a sinner, and offering himself to Jesus Christ.

        <h3>4. His son died</h3>
        <p>While Hamilton had managed to avoid confrontation and duel challenges throughout most of his life, his eldest son Philip was not so lucky. Three years before his duel with Burr, Philip had confronted a New York lawyer George Eacker after witnessing Eacker’s speech denouncing his father. When Eacker refused to retract his damning statements, a duel was set for the 20 November in Weehawken, New Jersey – the exact same location where his father would be shot almost three years later. Eacker escaped unscathed, but Philip was shot above the right hip and died an agonizing death the following day. The loss devastated the Hamilton family, and many historians believe it led to Hamilton’s own reluctance to fire directly at Aaron Burr during their legendary duel just three years later.
            On November 23, 1801, Philip faced George Eacker in a duel that eventually ended his life. Both men took ten paces from each other then turned to face the opposition. They did not fire instantly after turning.                                                                                                                                             Phillip and George stood still for the first minute before raising their pistols to take aim. The duel ended with Phillip taking the bullet in his body before it lodged itself into his arm. Hamilton’s son fell on the ground bleeding but remained his poise. He died with dignity even until his last minute, accounts have claimed.

        <h3>5. Alexander finally got his college degree, 214 years after his death.
        </h3>
        <p>Alexander Hamilton received his college degree in May 2018, 214 years since his passing. Douglas Hamilton, Alexander’s fifth great-grandson, received the honorary award. Albany Law School in New York awarded the degree to the late founding father. Hamilton had studied and practiced law in Albany, New York.

        <h3>6. Probably lied about his age
        </h3>
        <p>We know Hamilton was born on January 11; what’s in doubt is the year he was born. Hamilton, a native of the Caribbean island of Nevis, repeatedly said he was born in 1757. But official Nevisian records cite 1755 as his birth year. His college search may have had something to do with the discrepancy. According to Ron Chernow, author of the biography Alexander Hamilton, “While applying to Princeton, Hamilton may have decided to ‘correct’ his real age and shed a couple of years. Prodigies aren’t supposed to be over aged freshman.”

        <h3>7. Not allowed to attend school</h3>
        <p>Hamilton’s parents were never married. Because of this, Hamilton was barred from attending school. He was privately educated, and pored over his family’s collection of classics. He remained an avid reader and writer after he was orphaned. His father had abandoned his family when Hamilton was just a boy, and his mother died not long after.
